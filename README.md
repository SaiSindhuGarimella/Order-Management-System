# Order Management System

A full-stack asynchronous order processing platform with a React dashboard, FastAPI backend, Redis queue, MongoDB database, and automated worker service.

##  Features

- **Modern React UI** - Clean, responsive dashboard built with Material-UI
- **RESTful API** - FastAPI backend with automatic OpenAPI documentation
- **Asynchronous Processing** - Redis-based queue system for order fulfillment
- **Real-time Updates** - Live order status tracking on the dashboard
- **Containerized** - Full Docker and Docker Compose support
- **CI/CD Ready** - GitHub Actions pipeline for automated testing and deployment
- **Cloud-Ready** - MongoDB Atlas integration for cloud database



**Flow:**
1. User creates order via React UI
2. Backend API saves order to MongoDB and pushes to Redis queue
3. Worker service consumes from queue, processes order (5s delay simulation)
4. Worker updates order status in MongoDB
5. Frontend displays real-time status updates

### GitHub Actions ‚Äì Automated CI/CD Workflows
In this project, GitHub Actions were implemented to automate the entire Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) process, ensuring that the system remains stable, tested, and up to date with every code change.
All automation workflows are defined inside the .github/workflows directory, which contains YAML configuration files that specify how the application is built, tested, and deployed automatically whenever a new commit or pull request is made.
The following workflows are used in this project:
-**ci.yml ‚Äî Continuous Integration:**
This workflow is triggered whenever new code is pushed to the repository.
It automatically sets up both Python (FastAPI backend) and Node.js (React frontend) environments, installs all dependencies, builds the application, and validates that there are no issues.
This ensures that every update passes through a verified build process before merging.
-**test.yml ‚Äî Automated Testing:**
This workflow executes all test cases after the CI stage completes successfully.
It verifies backend API endpoints, frontend UI functionality, and the overall stability of the system.
Running tests automatically helps detect bugs or regressions early, maintaining a consistent and reliable codebase.
-**deploy.yml ‚Äî Continuous Deployment:**
Once the build and tests pass, this workflow handles the deployment process.
It packages and deploys the latest version of the frontend and backend to the hosting environment.
This ensures that the most recent stable build is always live, reducing manual effort and enabling faster, more reliable updates.
By integrating these workflows, the GitHub Actions pipeline provides an efficient, fully automated process for building, testing, and deploying the project.
This not only increases development speed but also guarantees consistency, reliability, and continuous delivery of new features without downtime or human error.
